# OpenSourceSectors 😎

🗒️This is a plugin for [Minecraft Server (Spigot API)](https://spigotmc.org/) introduces a sector system which connects a single world across multiple servers.

🍎The reason why I released this plugin is because I would like to make combining servers into one to spread out load between them easier. 
👉Finally, I am glad to provide the OpenSourceSectors, and everyone is welcome to adjust the code and help make it better by editting the code, adding new features, etc.

# Requirements 📗
- Bungeecord
- Spigot servers (as many you want)
- Private address space (to internal communication between servers) (eg. 127.0.0.1, 172.16.0.0, etc...)

# Usage ✔️
🎉Download the latest stable release from [releases page](https://github.com/Inder00/OpenSourceSectors/releases), put the BungeeCord plugin into the BungeeCord Server and configure it, put the Spigot plugin into every Spigot server and configure the master server (look at BungeeCord configuration for more information) and launch all servers.

# How it works ❓
💻Bungeecord becomes a "master server" which provides configuraction for each Spigot server, but you have to set a server-name for each Spigot server and the "master server" configuration (ip, port and password - `optional`). Once all servers are up and running, everything will be ready to use.

# Spigot listeners 🖤
#### PlayerChangeSectorEvent
```java
public class PlayerChangeSectorListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onSectorChange(PlayerChangeSectorEvent event) {
        event.getPlayer(); // Return player that's trying to change sector
        event.getSector(); // Return sector, that player is trying to reach
        event.setCancelled(true); // You can cancel this event. Then player can't change sector
    }
}
```
